Is it&mdash;&ldquo;Do you want the beach ball?&rdquo; or&mdash;&ldquo;Do you feel obligated to bounce...&rdquo; Hold on, hold on, hold on, &rsquo;cause I need to figure this out. To me, it&rsquo;s not so much getting hit in the head with a beach ball, it&rsquo;s getting hit in the head with someone who didn&rsquo;t know where to hit the ball. Do you like the beach ball&mdash;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Do you not like the beach ball&mdash;&ldquo;No?&rdquo; See I&rsquo;m not a beach ball fan, that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to go to a concert. But then again I always was the tall guy; I never stood behind a taller guy, so I always had fun at concerts. I am officially the tall guy who was in front of you at every show you&rsquo;ve every been to. But now I&rsquo;m in front of y&rsquo;all at the same time, so let&rsquo;s hear it for me for my sticktoitiveness. </span>

                <span class="text"> My goal was: how am I like a hundred percent of the time the same Jerry Lorenzo, you know what I mean?&mdash;So that I don&rsquo;t have to change when I get home or I don&rsquo;t have to be someone different when I&rsquo;m at work. My thought process was initially to try to keep everything kind of separate and in doing so I was approaching things with a different level of integrity or a different character. Not only what I was touching at home, in my work, and my friends, and my social life; they were inconsistent. And so um, that inconsistency in and of itself is like a heavy weight to have to turn off and on these different characters, and so, like you said, I&rsquo;ve just been trying to be the same person like a hundred percent of the time so that if you hit me up like &ldquo;yo we&rsquo;re gonna do this interview&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have to prepare; who I am is who I am. It relieves me of the preparation, it relieves me of that off and on switch. Obviously there&rsquo;s times, you know, we need to be on for other reasons; if we&rsquo;re you know, in the boardroom, talking to Adidas, or whatever that may be. It comes from the same spirit, but the level of on-ness is maybe higher but yeah, who I am at the end of the day, I&rsquo;ve been striving to just kind of be the same Jerry all the time. </span>

                <span class="text"> Oh, how we often look at life as something that should be a one way track going ever higher and higher. It is, however, not that way at all. Succes lies in achieving A, then allowing it to be partly broken down, before overachieving A, and that repeatedly. Think of when building a house or designing a garment. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that something should ever be one big succes throughout. Allow yourself to learn, start over, and achieving even better results by doing so. The same holds true for the days we spend. Off-days are part of the journey and have their value as the &ldquo;breaking down&rdquo; between achievements. </span>

                <span class="text"> When Marco was finished, he looked at himself in his new suit: here was such anonymity, such protection. Even if someone were to accidentally graze his back,   he was wearing enough layers so that they&rsquo;d never be able to feel the ridges of scars beneath. Everything was covered, everything was hidden. If he was standing still, he could be anyone, someone blank and invisible.
                &ldquo;I think maybe half an inch more,&rdquo; Marco said, pinching the back of the jacket in around the waist. He swatted some threads off his sleeve. &ldquo;Now all you need&rsquo;s a good haircut.&rdquo;
                He found Harold waiting for him in the tie area, reading a magazine. &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; he asked, as if the entire trip had been his idea and Harold had been the one indulging his whimsy.
                Over their early dinner, he tried to thank Harold again, but every time he tried, Harold stopped him with increasing impatience. &ldquo;Has anyone ever told you that sometimes you just need to accept things, Jude?&rdquo; he finally asked.
                &ldquo;You said to never just accept anything,&rdquo; he reminded Harold.
                &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in the classroom and in the courtroom,&rdquo; Harold said. &ldquo;Not in life. You see, Jude, in life, sometimes nice things happen to good people. You don&rsquo;t need to worry&mdash;they don&rsquo;t happen as often as they should. But when they do, it&rsquo;s up to the good people to just say &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; and move on, and maybe consider that the person who&rsquo;s doing the nice thing gets a bang out of it as well, and really isn&rsquo;t in the mood to hear all the reasons that the person for whom he&rsquo;s done the nice thing doesn&rsquo;t think he deserves it or isn&rsquo;t worthy of it.&rdquo;
                He shut up then, and after dinner he let Harold drive him back to his apartment on Hereford Street. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Harold said as he was getting out of the car, &ldquo;you looked really, really nice. You&rsquo;re a great-looking kid; I hope someone&rsquo;s told you that before.&rdquo; And then, before he could protest, &ldquo;Acceptance, Jude.&rdquo;
                So he swallowed what he was going to say. &ldquo;Thank you, Harold. For everything.&rdquo;
                &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very welcome, Jude,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you Monday.&rdquo; </span>
