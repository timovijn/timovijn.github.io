Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become sets become tournaments, and it&rsquo;s all so tightly connected that any point can become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It&rsquo;s our choice. </p> </span>

            <span class="text"> <p> Steven Wise, the founder of the NhRP, grew up in Maryland, and his family went to a farmers&rsquo; market once a month. There were animals for sale&mdash;in particular, chickens, crammed into small cages. To Wise, they appeared to be suffering. Although he had petse&mdash;a dog, named Gravy, and a succession of goldfish, mostly named Jacke&mdash;he had given little thought to the question of animal welfare. But the plight of the chickens so moved him that, at the age of eleven, he wrote a letter to a state representative to call his attention to the subject. The representative wrote back, but nothing changed for the chickens. </p> <p> As a teen-ager, Wise joined a couple of rock bands, vaguely hoping to make a career in music. In 1968, he enrolled at the College of William & Mary. Drawn to protests against the Vietnam War and issues of social justice, he became active in left-wing politics. He thought about going to medical school, but his grades weren&rsquo;t good enough. He attended law school at Boston University instead, but he was drifting. He had the profile of someone who was looking for a cause. </p> </span>

Researchers call this the fixed-pie bias: People, particularly those with limited experience making deals, assume that a negotiation is a zero-sum game in which their own interests conflict directly with a counterpart&rsquo;s. (More-experienced negotiators, in contrast, look for ways to expand the pie through collaboration, rather than nakedly trying to snatch a bigger slice.) </p> </span>

            <span class="text"> <p>In this context we would point out that men should be at greater pains than heretofore to form a superior class of independent thinkers, unamenable to intimidation and fervent in the quest of truth, whose function it would be to guide the masses dependent on their lead. There is no need to point out how little the rule of politicians and the Church&rsquo;s ban on liberty of thought encourage such a new creation. The ideal conditions would obviously be found in a community where every man subordinated his instinctive life to the dictates of reason. Nothing less than this could bring about so thorough and so durable a union between men, even if this involved the severance of mutual ties of sentiment. But surely such a hope is utterly utopian, as things are. The other indirect methods of preventing war are certainly more feasible, but entail no quick results. They conjure up an ugly picture of mills that grind so slowly that, before the flour is ready, men are dead of hunger.</p> <br> <p>Hiervan zou men moeten uitgaan, men zou meer zorg dan tot nu toe moeten besteden aan de opvoeding van een bovenlaag van zelfstandig denkende, voor geen intimidatie vatbare, naar waarheid strevende menschen, die de leiding der onzelfstandige massa tot taak zouden krijgen. Dat de aanmatiging van het staatsgezag en het denkverbod der kerk voor het kweeken van zoo&rsquo;n bovenlaag niet gunstig zijn, behoeft niet te worden betoogd. De ideale toestand zou natuurlijk een gemeenschap van menschen zijn, die hun aandriften hebben onderworpen aan de dictatuur van het verstand. Met geen ander middel zou een zoo volkomen en krachtige vereeniging der menschen geschapen kunnen worden; men zou zelfs afstand kunnen doen van de tusschen hen bestaande gevoelsbanden. Doch dat is hoogstwaarschijnlijk een utopie. De andere wegen naar een indirecte verhindering van den oorlog zijn ongetwijfeld gemakkelijker te banen, maar zij stellen geen snel succes in het vooruitzicht. Ongaarne denkt men aan molens, die zoo langzaam malen, dat men verhongert voordat men het meel krijgt.</p>

Is it&mdash;&ldquo;Do you want the beach ball?&rdquo; or&mdash;&ldquo;Do you feel obligated to bounce...&rdquo; Hold on, hold on, hold on, &rsquo;cause I need to figure this out. To me, it&rsquo;s not so much getting hit in the head with a beach ball, it&rsquo;s getting hit in the head with someone who didn&rsquo;t know where to hit the ball. Do you like the beach ball&mdash;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Do you not like the beach ball&mdash;&ldquo;No?&rdquo; See I&rsquo;m not a beach ball fan, that&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to go to a concert. But then again I always was the tall guy; I never stood behind a taller guy, so I always had fun at concerts. I am officially the tall guy who was in front of you at every show you&rsquo;ve every been to. But now I&rsquo;m in front of y&rsquo;all at the same time, so let&rsquo;s hear it for me for my sticktoitiveness. </span>

            <span class="text"> My goal was: how am I like a hundred percent of the time the same Jerry Lorenzo, you know what I mean?&mdash;So that I don&rsquo;t have to change when I get home or I don&rsquo;t have to be someone different when I&rsquo;m at work. My thought process was initially to try to keep everything kind of separate and in doing so I was approaching things with a different level of integrity or a different character. Not only what I was touching at home, in my work, and my friends, and my social life; they were inconsistent. And so um, that inconsistency in and of itself is like a heavy weight to have to turn off and on these different characters, and so, like you said, I&rsquo;ve just been trying to be the same person like a hundred percent of the time so that if you hit me up like &ldquo;yo we&rsquo;re gonna do this interview&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have to prepare; who I am is who I am. It relieves me of the preparation, it relieves me of that off and on switch. Obviously there&rsquo;s times, you know, we need to be on for other reasons; if we&rsquo;re you know, in the boardroom, talking to Adidas, or whatever that may be. It comes from the same spirit, but the level of on-ness is maybe higher but yeah, who I am at the end of the day, I&rsquo;ve been striving to just kind of be the same Jerry all the time. </span>

              After this he registered at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, and immersed himself in the study of physics. A few years later, in 1905, he sent three articles to the most prestigious scientific journal of the period, the Annalen der Physik. Each of these is worthy of a Nobel Prize. The first shows that atoms really exist. The second lays the first foundation for quantum mechanics, which I will discuss in the next lesson. The third presents his first theory of relativity (known today as &ldquo;special relativity&rdquo;), the theory which elucidates how time does not pass identically for everyone: two identical twins find that they are different in age, if one of them has travelled at speed.

            <span class="text"> How often we wish our life to be a one way track that leads to more beautiful destinations continuously. Although it should not be that way at all! Succes and the happiness that accompanies it lie in achieving something, then allowing it to be partly broken down before overachieving it&mdash;and that repeatedly. Think of when building a house or designing a garment. Do not fall into the trap of thinking that something should ever be one big triumph throughout. Allow yourself to learn, start over, and achieve even better results by doing so. The same holds true for the days we spend during our lives; off-days are part of the journey and have their value as the &ldquo;breaking down&rdquo; between achievements. </span>

Or they don&rsquo;t burn their favorite candle because they want to save it for a special evening. How many of us do that with all sorts of things in life; not wanting to take the risk and then all of a sudden five years pass and you have a full bottle of stale perfume, or your favorite candle is collecting dust. Life passed you by before you even knew it because you were waiting for something special, or living in fear, when every day is important.

He&rsquo;s a big swinging egotistical c*ck in arguments and that&rsquo;s a fact. What I&rsquo;m saying is, in arguments you say &ldquo;I like to pull out my swords&rdquo; and you f*ck people up; you slash and dice, you cut. Listen, it&rsquo;s not always productive for a conversation that has such intellectual variance and so many factors. When you put someone against the fence; a lot of times it changes their confidence, their understanding. Real conversation that drives productive conversation and productive debate should be comfortable in nature and take place in a respectful environment. </span>

Even if someone were to accidentally graze his back,   he was wearing enough layers so that they&rsquo;d never be able to feel the ridges of scars beneath. Everything was covered, everything was hidden. If he was standing still, he could be anyone, someone blank and invisible.
            &ldquo;I think maybe half an inch more,&rdquo; Marco said, pinching the back of the jacket in around the waist. He swatted some threads off his sleeve. &ldquo;Now all you need&rsquo;s a good haircut.&rdquo;
            He found Harold waiting for him in the tie area, reading a magazine. &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; he asked, as if the entire trip had been his idea and Harold had been the one indulging his whimsy.
            Over their early dinner, he tried to thank Harold again, but every time he tried, Harold stopped him with increasing impatience. &ldquo;Has anyone ever told you that sometimes you just need to accept things, Jude?&rdquo; he finally asked.
            &ldquo;You said to never just accept anything,&rdquo; he reminded Harold.
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in the classroom and in the courtroom,&rdquo; Harold said. &ldquo;Not in life. You see, Jude, in life, sometimes nice things happen to good people. You don&rsquo;t need to worry&mdash;they don&rsquo;t happen as often as they should. But when they do, it&rsquo;s up to the good people to just say &lsquo;thank you,&rsquo; and move on, and maybe consider that the person who&rsquo;s doing the nice thing gets a bang out of it as well, and really isn&rsquo;t in the mood to hear all the reasons that the person for whom he&rsquo;s done the nice thing doesn&rsquo;t think he deserves it or isn&rsquo;t worthy of it.&rdquo;
            He shut up then, and after dinner he let Harold drive him back to his apartment on Hereford Street. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; Harold said as he was getting out of the car, &ldquo;you looked really, really nice. You&rsquo;re a great-looking kid; I hope someone&rsquo;s told you that before.&rdquo; And then, before he could protest, &ldquo;Acceptance, Jude.&rdquo;
            So he swallowed what he was going to say. &ldquo;Thank you, Harold. For everything.&rdquo;
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very welcome, Jude,&rdquo; said Harold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you Monday.&rdquo; </span>
